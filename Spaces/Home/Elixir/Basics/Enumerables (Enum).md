Related to [[Lists]] as this is a module in order to manipulate these objects, except for tuples. 

Common Functions: 
- `all?`
	- This function allows you to check a list, if any of them evaluate to `false` the function will return `false`.
- `any?`
	- This function is much like `all?` except when a single value in the enumerable evaluates to `true` it will evaluate to true. 
- Chunking
	- `chunk_every`
		- This function will split an enumerable into several, equally sized chunks. 
		- the `:discard` argument will remove all of the values that remain after the chunking. 
	- `chunk_by`
		- This allows you to group each enumerable based off something other than size.

- `each`
