Related to [[Data Types]]. 
- Lists
	- Lists are simple unordered collections of values, they don't have to be unique nor of the same type. 
		- The way that this structure is implemented is via a linked list, where a pointed points to the next object in the array and so on. 
			- This means that appending (putting the object at the end) a item to the list has a complexity of O(n) while prepending (placing a value at the front of the list) has a complexity of O(1)
			- This lends itself to a First-In First Out approach to handling these lists.
