## What is Elixir? 
This is standard boiler plate but I want to list out the features that the elixir language has. 
- Embraces the functional programming paradigm, with immutable variables and first class functions.
- Python-like syntax
- Easy Concurrency where individual modules or functions could be spawned as a sub-process and be able to communicate with its siblings very well. 
- It is built on-top of Erlang's BEAM VM allowing for
	- Fault Tolerance, Only the faulty process will fail, allowing the supervisor process to restart it. 
	- Compatibility with Erlang, they're both compiled down to the same bytecode. 
	- Additionally Elixir leverages this in order to allow its concurrency model to work properly under-the-hood so to speak. 
- It's scalable due to it's concurrency model. 
- It also allows for hot-reloading. 
- Additionally you can also perform meta-programming, allowing for the ability to "program the programming language."
