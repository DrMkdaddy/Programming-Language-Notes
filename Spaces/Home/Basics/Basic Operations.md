- Integers and Floats
	- They both support basic arithmetic operators like 
		- `* and /` for multiplication and division
			- CAUTION: The `/` Operator will always return a float, in order to avoid that it is required to use the `div(dividend, divisor)` function in order to return a proper integer. Additionally the `rem(dividend, divisor)` function does the same work but for the remainder. 
		- `+ and -` for addition and subtraction
- Booleans
	- Booleans have basic operators that are very close to logic gates.
