Basic Data Types in Elixir: 
- Integers
	- Whole numbers, no decimals. They can be positive or negative. 
	- This value also has support for binary, octal, and hexadecimal numbers as well, so `0b110`, `0o644`, and `0x1F` are all valid declarations. With the value after the 0 defining whether or not it's a binary, octal, or hexadecimal value. 
	- Example definition: `myVar = 2`
- Floats
	- Numbers, with decimals. `2.0` < this is an example of a float despite the decimal being worth nothing. They can be positive or negative. 
	- These support `e` for exponential values, like `1.0e-10`! 
	- Example definition: `myVar = 2.0`
- Booleans
	- True / False. Everything is truthy except for `false` and `nil`. 
	- Example definition: `myVar = false (or true)`
- Atoms
	- A variable where the name is also the value. For example, `:true` will return the boolean `true` and `:ImHungry` will return `"I'm Hungry"`. 
	- The names of Modules are also Atoms, even if they haven't been declared yet. 
	- Atoms are also used to reference modules from Erlang libraries, and even ones that are built in. 
	- Example definition: `:Anything`. This Object is strange as the definition syntax only hinges on this `:` no equals sign or nothing. 
- Strings
	- They're strings! They're UTF-8 by default. Support Line Breaks and escape sequences like `\r\n` and are wrapped with double quotes like `""`!
